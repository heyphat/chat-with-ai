Here’s a classic proof that is suitable for high school students: the proof that the square root of 2 is irrational.\n\n### Theorem: $\\sqrt{2}$ is irrational.\n\n#### Proof by Contradiction:\n\n1. **Assume the opposite:** Suppose $\\sqrt{2}$ is rational. This means that it can be expressed as a fraction of two integers in simplest form:\n   $$ \\sqrt{2} = \\frac{a}{b} $$\n   where $a$ and $b$ are integers that have no common factors (i.e., the fraction is in lowest terms) and $b \\neq 0$.\n\n2. **Square both sides:** \n   $$ 2 = \\frac{a^2}{b^2} $$\n   This implies:\n   $$ a^2 = 2b^2 $$\n\n3. **Analyzing the equation:** From the equation $a^2 = 2b^2$, we see that $a^2$ is equal to $2$ times an integer ($b^2$). This means that $a^2$ is even (since it can be expressed as two times some integer).\n\n4. **Concluding about $a$:** If $a^2$ is even, then $a$ must also be even (because the square of an odd number is odd). Therefore, we can write:\n   $$ a = 2k $$\n   for some integer $k$.\n\n5. **Substituting back:** Now, substituting $a = 2k$ into the equation $a^2 = 2b^2$, we get:\n   $$(2k)^2 = 2b^2$$\n   This simplifies to:\n   $$ 4k^2 = 2b^2 $$\n   Dividing both sides by 2 gives:\n   $$ 2k^2 = b^2 $$\n\n6. **Analyzing $b$:** This shows that $b^2$ is also even, which means that $b$ must be even as well.\n\n7. **Conclusion:** Since both $a$ and $b$ are even, they have at least 2 as a common factor. This contradicts our original assumption that $a$ and $b$ have no common factors (i.e., that $\\frac{a}{b}$ was in simplest form).\n\n8. **Final statement:** Therefore, our initial assumption that $\\sqrt{2}$ is rational must be false. Hence, we conclude that $\\sqrt{2}$ is irrational.\n\nThis proof is a classic example of proof by contradiction and is often taught in high school mathematics.
